    "- [**Gaussian elimination**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_elimination), also known as **row reduction** is probably the most popular algorithm for solving systems of linear equations by hand. But nowadays, we rarely solve systems of linear equations by hand (especially if they exceed, say, three or four equations). \n",
    "\n",
    "- Row reduction produces a matrix decomposition of the original matrix. The elementary row operations may be viewed as the multiplication on the left of the original matrix by elementary matrices. Then the first part of the algorithm computes an **[LU decomposition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LU_decomposition)**, while the second part writes the original matrix as the product of a uniquely determined invertible matrix and a uniquely determined reduced row echelon matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Efficiency: The number of arithmetic operations required to perform row reduction is one way of measuring the algorithm's computational efficiency. For example, to solve a system of $n$ equations for $n$ unknowns by performing row operations on the matrix until it is in reduced row echelon form, and then solving for each unknown in reverse order, requires $n(n + 1)/2$ divisions, $(2n3 + 3n2 − 5n)/6$ multiplications, and $(2n3 + 3n2 − 5n)/6$ subtractions, for a total of approximately $2n^3/3$ operations. Thus it has a arithmetic complexity of $O(n^3)$.  The cost becomes prohibitive for systems with millions of equations (which are very common nowadays)."
