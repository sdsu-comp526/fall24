# Assignment 2:
5. Use your bisection code to approximate a root of $f(x) = \frac{|x-2|}{x^3 - 2 x^2 + x -2}$ on the interval $[1, 4]$ with error no more than $10^{-4}$.
6. Use your bisection code to approximate a root of $f(x) = \frac{|x-2|}{x^3 - 2 x^2 + x -2}$ on the interval $[4, 6]$ with error no more than $10^{-4}$.

Questions:
- What is the relative condition number of f?
- Is the function ill/well-conditioned for all values of x in [1,6]?


# Assignment 3:
3. Use Newton's method to solve Exercise 10.3 points 1 and 3 from the Bisection method class. Which method performs better on these functions and why?
