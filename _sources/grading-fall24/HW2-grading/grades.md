  (-5 for changing the signature of the function; -5 did not use fabs as suggested and did not use absolute value at all; halved the interval length, effectively doubling the tolerance; -10 for not printing failure case; -5 for submitting 5000+ files! +7 for the EC question, but not answering ill/well-conditioned? (-5) And not saving in a png file (-3))

  (-40: ran bisection funct with a wrong return type. Failed to see that the found value was not a zero! Did not use fabs as suggested and did not use absolute value at all; halved the interval length, effectively doubling the tolerance. + 7 for EC not answering ill/well-conditioned? (-5) And not saving in a png file (-3))

  (+100 for the regular question; +12 for EC; the julia program did not save in a png file directly, but he did it manually and submitted the png file)

  (+100 for the C program; 7 for the EC. Used FD for defining the derivative (-5); and did not save in a png file (-3))

  (+65: (-5) changed the signature; changed the algo! (-5) Did not check the abs(b-a) > tol condition, but abs(mid) > tol; (-10) did not check if function has opposite signs; (-10) for not printing reason of failure case; His method took 20 iters Vs 15 in solution; (-5) in the case the solution in the interval did not exist, his program printed that "converged towards 4.00." EC: +15)

  -5 for not printing why the solution was not found in the interval (he checked the condition, he just did not say why in the error message); EC (+12) not saving in a png file (-3)

  (-5) changed the signature; (-5) for not printing why the solution was not found in the interval (she checked the condition, she just did not say why in the error message); Did not use fabs as suggested. EC: (-3) plot legend and title do not correspond to the function being plotted; (-2) used only default np.arange between -10 and 5, which created only 15 points for the kappa plot

   (-15) Did not use fabs as suggested and did not use absolute value at all; halved the interval length, effectively doubling the tolerance. (-10) for not printing reason of failure case; In a comment he wrote: "this does not mean that there is no roots actually." which is wrong. EC: (-3) did not save in a png file
