2. Amey Pradeep Kulkarni: 90 Reviewed
   (-20%) for wrong Simpson rule; EX: (+10%) -5% for not plotting reference lines.

   No EC.
4. Katayoon Kaviani: 80 Reviewed
   (-25) for missing Part 4 of the Assignment: Comment on your results. For each execution; which method is better? And _why_? (-5% for having wrong errors. Something is off in her code) (+10% EC: she plotted all 5 exercise error plots in one single plot; very hard to read)
5. Oluchi Nzerem: 105 Reviewed
   (-10%) for wrong interval definition in Simpson's rule. (+15% EC)
6. Surinder Singh Chhabra: 100 Reviewed
   (-5%) for wrong Simpson's error ratios, even if the error themselves are correct. (-10%) for leaving commentary in the comments but without attempting to explain _why_ pr without commenting on order of convergence. (+15% EC)
7. Savanna Spayd: 85 Reviewed
   (-25%) for submitting a Jupyter Notebook instead of julia and Project/Manifest files. (-5%) for having wrong Simpson errors;  Something is off in her code (the exact same errors as Katy! Even though their code looks different).
   (+15% EC)
8. Tianna Calderon: 90 Reviewed
   (-5%) for wrong Simpson's errors and (-5%) for wrong Simpson's error ratios, even if the computed integrals themselves are almost correct.
   No EC.
9. Tyler Collins: 115 Reviewed
   No points off
10. Vince Verdugo: 90 Reviewed
   (-20%) for wrong Simpson rule;
   (+10%) EC: he plotted each method's convergence separately for all executions (a)-(e), instead of plotting for each execution (a)-(e) all methods in the same graphs so to compare their accuracy and rate of convergence for each function.
11. Xuerui Shi: 100 Reviewed
    (-10%) for misaligning the table entries by not using exponential/scientific notation, making the tables very hard to read.
    (-5%) for leaving commentary in the comments but without attempting to explain _why_ pr without commenting on order of convergence.
    (+15% EC)
12. Yiyue Feng: 95 Reviewed
    (-15%) for not leaving any commentary in the comments (he only wrote a couple of lines in the PR convo), nor uploading a separate file or attempting to explain _why_, and without commenting on order of convergence.
    (+10% EC) did not change the labels of the legend entries. Reused some from class, which are not relevant for this exercise. Also, the plots are overwritten for every execution. Could have saved each plot for each execution.
