# Slides

The class material includes Jupyter-based notebooks. These can be used and visualized as slides using [RISE](https://github.com/damianavila/RISE) (this is optional) for use during class.
You can view them here, or open them to interact. You can use any environment for your local development environment, or use the SDSU's [JupyterHub](https://jupyterhub.sdsu.edu/) on the [Instructional Cluster](https://sdsu-research-ci.github.io/instructionalcluster) to experiment and develop without a local install. If you have never logged-in before, check SDSU's Research & Cyberinfrastructure [resources for students](https://sdsu-research-ci.github.io/instructionalcluster/students). Once you are on the [Instructional Cluster](https://sdsu-research-ci.github.io/instructionalcluster) page, simply click on the `Launch JupyterHub` button.

If you decide to use SDSU's [Instructional Cluster](https://sdsu-research-ci.github.io/instructionalcluster)'s [JupyterHub](https://jupyterhub.sdsu.edu/), you can download each individual notebook from the class website, under the [slides](https://sdsu-comp526.github.io/fall24/slides.html) section on your machine, and once opened Jupyter on SDSU's JupyterHub you can select `Upload Files` and upload the desired notebook in the web app to interact with.

## Environment

This explains how I configure my environment so you can experiment with the slides locally, or adapt these tools for your own use.

### Install Required Packages

First of all, download and install [Julia](https://julialang.org/downloads/).

To interact with the notebooks, you want to install JupyterLab (new, richer ecosystem), via

```
pip install jupyterlab
```

Once installed, launch JupyterLab with:

```
jupyter lab
```
and selcet the Notebook app.

You can also only install the classic Jupyter Notebook standalone app via

```
pip install notebook
```

and to run the notebook type:

```
jupyter notebook
```

And for these (using Julia in Jupyter) you can run

```
julia -e 'import Pkg; Pkg.add("IJulia")'
```

from your terminal, or first start a Julia session with
```
julia
```

and then type:
```julia
]add IJulia
```

go back to your Julia REPL using backspace and type

```julia
julia> using IJulia
```

and then
```julia
julia> notebook()
```

to run the notebook.

#### Additional resources
You can open these notebooks as normal notebooks (continuous scroll). If you wish to use them as slides, one useful package is

* [RISE](https://github.com/damianavila/RISE): General editing and presentation of slides
  * Alt-R: Snap in and out of presentation mode
  * Shift-I: toggle slides
  * Shift-G: toggle fragment (incrementally revealed cells)


### Best practices

* When saving, use `Kernel -> Restart & Clear Output` to keep the stored data and diffs in the notebook small.
* For your images, several formats will do. Just keep in mind that PDF files are not web-friendly. PDF images can be converted to SVG using `pdf2svg`, and the result will still look sharp (unlike PNG) no matter the scale or zoom.
