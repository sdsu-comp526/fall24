# Notes on COMP526

## For this year:

- Participation: 5%
- Assignment 1: Git repo (10%)
- Assignment 2: C assignment (10%)
- Assignment 3: Julia (10%) ; some linear algebra? Use autograder!
- Assignment 4: Fortran assignment (10%)

- Midterm project: a choice of iterative linear system solver (except for CG) or least square (from Miguel) (%20)
- Final project: open-source contribution(%35)

## TODO:

- Wrapper of anonymous midterm feedback survey! Show them in class!

- Give another anonymous feedback/reflection survey or just a reflection in class at the end of the semester asking them about their own learning experience rather than my teaching style. Examples:
  * What is the most important thing/aspect you learned in this class?
  * How did you realize you were learning/mastering it?



- DONE: Mid-term assessment survey. Ask them also if they can reschule Final Exam 9-11:30 am.

- DONE: After the module4-4_cholesky_qr.ipynb notebook, add a lecture on direct Vs iterative solvers for linear systems (my PhD linear algebra lecture notes from Tuesday 12/04/12) DONE

- Lagrange Interpolation & Chebyshev Nodes DONE
- Differentiation
  - Forward/Backward and Centered Differences
  - First and Second order derivatives
- Numerical Integration
  - Gauss rule

- Finite Elements?

## For next year

- In the Git assignment (HW1) specify that they will learn the workflow that is going to be used for _all_ assignments for the remainder of the course!
