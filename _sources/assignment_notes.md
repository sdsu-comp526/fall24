- Final project: open-source contribution(%35)

TODO:

After the module4-4_cholesky_qr.ipynb notebook, add a lecture on direct Vs iterative solvers for linear systems (my PhD linear algebra lecture notes from Tuesday 12/04/12) DONE

- Lagrange Interpolation & Chebyshev Nodes
- Differentiation
  - Forward/Backward and Centered Differences
  - First and Second order derivatives
- Numerical Integration
  - Gauss rule

- Finite Elements?
